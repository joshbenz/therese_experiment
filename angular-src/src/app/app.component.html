          <p>This is a graph of all the bowls ali has ever visited, including the bowls that had the chicken in it (aka the ones she was supposed to).
            This graph was created by going through each data point and keeping count of each bowl color that she visited. Notice that there is way more blue 
            visits than there are white visits. There are two factors to take into consideration due to how the experiment was run, especially since all visits were counted. One is that once we switched
            to the blue bowl, we took out the white bowl for a lot of the data collected (basically all of them until the end). So it makes sense that didn't visit 
            white as much, because the bowl simply wasn't even an option. The second factor is that we have 67 data points for when the chicken bowl was the white 
            and 114 data points when the chickent bowl was blue. That means that the blue bar here automatically increases by at least 47 points over the white bowl.

              <p>Graphs that show the frequency of bowls visited when she did not check the correct chicken bowl on the first try. Note that the legend shows how many trials 
                she got wrong out of the total number of trials for that bowl (meaning this graph only counts data where she was wrong.) This graph was created by
                looking at each data point and first filtering out the chicken bowls by label (meaning the white tab only includes data points where the chiken bowl
                was white. Similarly the blue tab only includes data points where the chicken bowl was blue). Next I filtered out all the data points where the number
                of bowls visited was 1 (this means that the bowl that Ali visited first was the bowl that had the chicken. I can make this assumption because even when Ali picked 
                the correct bowl, Therese included it as a bowl visited.) Finally, I looked at each of the remaining data points and counted all of the bowls visited except
                for the color of the chicken bowl (meaning for the white label, I the count of the white visits. Similarly for the blue label, I exceluded the count for all 
                of the blue visits. I did this because with this graph, we are only interested in what Ali picked when she was wrong. However, of course the white count will 
                be 14 since she eventually ended up getting the correct bowl. Basically it doesn't add to the information that I am trying to show, so it was excluded).

            <p>This scatter plot graph shows the time trends. Each dot is a data point. You can see of each data point varies in each day. Each chicken
              bowl is plotted on the corresponding day, so you can compare the two bowls on a given day. For example, Day 1 has the data points for Day 1 of
              when the chicken bowl was white and the data points for Day 1 of when the chicken bowl was blue. This way you can commpare how quickly she learned
              the white bowl compared to the blue bowl. Also included in the this graph is a an average line for each bowl. This way you can compare how well she 
              performed with each bowl on average. This graph was created by first sorting all of the data points by date. Then I separate the data points by 
              the chicken bowl color. Next, I plot each data point for each day. Then, I sum up the times for each day for each chicken bowl color and divide by the
              number of data points (pretty much always 4) to obtain the average time and add that point 
              to the scatter plot. This is the average time for the day for each chicken bowl color. Finally, I connect the averages with lines to easily show the average 
              trend over time.

            <p>Does the initial order of the bowls matter? This is the question that was asked when creating this graph. When collecting the data, we preserved and recoreded
              the configuration of the bowls. I wanted to see if she performed worse in certain configurations compared to others. If the configuration of the bowls does not matter 
              then the line should be flat. Spikes in the graph would indicate that Ali performed poorly in that configuration. However, what is not taken into account that
              could also affect the spikes in the graph is the number of times that the configuarion was used (so the more that the configuarion was used, 
              the more opportunities she had to get it wrong). This graph was created by looking at each data point and creating a set (set implies that each configuration 
              is unique, aka no duplicate configurations) of unique configurations. For each configuarion, I counted how many visits were made and plotted it on the graph.
              Note that there is always at least one visit. This simply means that in that configuarion, she the only bowl she visited was the correct bowl. Now, for example, 
              in the highest peaks of the graph, Ali performed worst when the configuration started with the clear bowl. However, there are other configurations where the colors start
              with clear and she performs well. So looking at one bowl probably isn't good enough to decide. Is there some similarities between the configurations where she does not 
              perform well?
